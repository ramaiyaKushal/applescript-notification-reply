Instead of using the mouse and click twice to reply here's an alternate using Apple Script

Open Automator > New *Service* > Run AppleScript > paste applescript.txt in Run AppleScrript box.

Change Setting of the Workflow receives "no input" in "any application"

Save Workflow

Open System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services > Scroll to General > Tick the workflow name and double tap on none to add shortcut keys.

Open Security & Privacy > Accessibility > Tick apps while which the workflow should run. Eg Safari, Chrome, PyCharm
